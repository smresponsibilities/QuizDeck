# Kahoot Clone - Backend

## Description

This is the backend part of the Kahoot Clone project. It is built with Express.js and handles all API requests, user authentication, and real-time communication using WebSockets. It also manages the database interactions with MongoDB, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm (v6.x or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.x or higher)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend

```

2. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URI
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET
PORT=5000

```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
node index.js

```

2. The server will be running on `http://localhost:PORT`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with MongoDB, ensure that the MongoDB service is running and accessible. Check the connection string in the `.env` file.
- If the server fails to start, check the logs for error messages and ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- For issues with real-time quiz participation, ensure that the WebSocket connection is established and working properly.
- If you experience performance issues, consider optimizing database queries and using caching mechanisms.
